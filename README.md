# VLC for Android

## About this branch: Lyrics
I made the just work patch for adding lyrics function for audio.

But I'm sorry about the "dirty" code, so It will not be merged to the original repo.
But anyone need the lyrics is welcome to download the apk from the release section of this repo.

* support .lrc external lyrics
* support for remember play position for each audio is not work (why?)
* small issue like lyrics not shown when pause is pressed

Thanks

This is the official **Android** port of [VLC](https://videolan.org/vlc/).

VLC on Android plays all the same files as the classical version of VLC, and features a media database
for Audio and Video files and stream.

## Project Structure

Here are the current folders of vlc-android project:

- extension-api : Application extensions SDK (not released yet)
- application : Android application source code, organized by modules.
- buildsystem : Build scripts, CI and maven publication configuration
- libvlc : LibVLC gradle module, VLC source code will be cloned in `vlc/` at root level.
- medialibrary : Medialibrary gradle module

## LibVLC

LibVLC is the Android library embedding VLC engine, which provides a lot of multimedia features, like:

- Play every media file formats, every codec and every streaming protocols
- Hardware and efficient decoding on every platform, up to 8K
- Network browsing for distant filesystems (SMB, FTP, SFTP, NFS...) and servers (UPnP, DLNA)
- Playback of Audio CD, DVD and Bluray with menu navigation
- Support for HDR, including tonemapping for SDR streams
- Audio passthrough with SPDIF and HDMI, including for Audio HD codecs, like DD+, TrueHD or DTS-HD
- Support for video and audio filters
- Support for 360 video and 3D audio playback, including Ambisonics
- Ability to cast and stream to distant renderers, like Chromecast and UPnP renderers.

And more.

![LibVLC stack](https://images.videolan.org/images/libvlc_stack.png)

You can use our LibVLC module to power your own Android media player.
Download the `.aar` directly from [Maven](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.videolan.android/libvlc-all) or build from source.

Have a look at our [sample codes](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libvlc-android-samples).

## License

VLC for Android is licensed under [GPLv2 (or later)](COPYING). Android libraries make this, de facto, a GPLv3 application.

VLC engine *(LibVLC)* for Android is licensed under [LGPLv2](libvlc/COPYING.LIB).

## Build

Native libraries are published on bintray. So you can:

- Build the application and get libraries via gradle dependencies (JVM build only)
- Build the whole app (LibVLC + Medialibrary + Application)
- Build LibVLC only, and get an .aar package

### Build Application

VLC-Android build relies on gradle build modes :

- `Release` & `Debug` will get LibVLC and Medialibrary from Bintray, and build application source code only.
- `SignedRelease` also, but it will allow you to sign application apk with a local keystore.
- `Dev` will build build LibVLC, Medialibrary, and then build the application with these binaries. (via build scripts only)

### Build LibVLC

You will need a recent Linux distribution to build VLC.
It should work with Windows 10, and macOS, but there is no official support for this.

#### Setup

Check our [AndroidCompile wiki page](https://wiki.videolan.org/AndroidCompile/), especially for build dependencies.

Here are the essential points:

On Debian/Ubuntu, install the required dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install automake ant autopoint cmake build-essential libtool-bin \
    patch pkg-config protobuf-compiler ragel subversion unzip git \
    openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jdk flex python wget
```

Setup the build environment:
Set `$ANDROID_SDK` to point to your Android SDK directory
`export ANDROID_SDK=/path/to/android-sdk`

Set `$ANDROID_NDK` to point to your Android NDK directory
`export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/android-ndk`

Then, you are ready to build!

#### Build

`buildsystem/compile.sh -l -a <ABI>`

ABI can be `arm`, `arm64`, `x86`, `x86_64` or `all` for a multi-abis build

You can do a library release build with `-r` argument

#### Medialibrary

Build Medialibrary with `-ml` instead of `-l`
